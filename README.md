# Gradient_Descent_Linear_Model
Simple gradient descent model for linear model, this code implements gradient descent to fit a linear model to the provided data points. The function gradient descent updates the parameters m (slope) and b (intercept) to minimize the cost function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual y values.
